- Version 0.0.9 - Wed Apr 25 22:07:44 UTC 2012

 * Create `README.md` from `timezone.idl`. `.idl` is a document format for a
   document generator that I'm never going to write.
 * Move grumbling from `README.md` to `MOTIVATIONS.md`.
 * Add `milliseconds` as a synonym for `millis` to date math.
 * Configuration via partial functions.
 * Fix subtraction of years as per #10.
 * Attempt to create JSON as Olson by parsing the Olson files backwards in time.
 * Convert intermediate interval boundaries format to start time from end time.
 * Interpret slash delimited timezone abbreviations.
 * Interpret zone records with a specific savings offset.
 * Correctly convert between standard, wall-clock and POSIX time in preprocessing.
 * Correctly interpret rules that occur at the 24th hour; 24:00.
 * Correctly format `%Z`.
 * Use binary search against a generated table of rules.
 * Organize precompiler into a library and separate programs.
 * Create experimental 7-bit encoding and push it to the sidelines.
 * Redo intermediate zone file format, create clock property, offset in POSIX
   time.
 * Use `Date` to calculate last day of month.
 * Parse Olson files going forward in time, not backwards.
 * Remove generated timezone files from git.
 * Automate download of Olson file source, compilation of of `zic`, and Olson as
   JSON files.
 * Build `zic` at Travis CI for testing.
 * Remove locale aware date parsing. (NLP is out of scope.)
 * Parse New Year's 1970. (Was confused over `0` and `undefined`.)
 * Calculate timezone lookup table to 2037.
