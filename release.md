### Release Checklist

Created a program to generate the markdown for a release checklist. When it is
time to release a new version of Timezone, the release checklist makes sure that
I don't miss a step of a tedious procedure. Plus it gives me some commands that
I can copy and paste to prevent fat fingering and mis-remembering.
