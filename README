PURPOSE

Timezone is a MicroJS library in pure JavaScript with no dependencies that
provides timezone aware date math and date formatting.

Timezone uses the IANA Database to determine the correct wall clock time
anywhere in the world for any time since the dawn of standardized time.

Timezone formats dates with a full implementation of `strftime` formats,
including the GNU `date` extensions.

Timezone represents time in POSIX time and local time using RFC 3999 date
strings.

Timezone is a full featured standards based time library in pure JavaScript for
under 3K minified and gzipped.
